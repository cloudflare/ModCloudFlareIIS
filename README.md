IIS Module for CloudFlare users 
================================

*Restores original visitor IP address to web applications running on IIS and using CloudFlare's performance and security service, even on IPv6!

*Adds original visitor IP address to logs

Tested with IIS 7, 7.5 and 8. Known to compile using .NET 2.0 or later.

More background on [seeing the original visitor IP address in logs when using CloudFlare](https://support.cloudflare.com/entries/22055137-why-do-my-server-logs-show-cloudflare-s-ips-using-cloudflare "CloudFlare"). More about [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com)

Rough installation instructions
------------------------------

1. Compile, if needed.
2. Copy all .dll files to the BIN folder in the root of your desired application/website folder. If this folder doesn't exist, then create it.
3. In the IIS Manager, go to the website/application's "Modules" section.
4. Right click, or use the interface to "Add Managed Module"
5. Use "ModCloudFlare" as the name. (This is actually arbitrary.)
6. For "Type" simply type in ModCloudFlareIIS.ModCloudFlare. (This should autocomplete. If it doesn't, the DLL files are likely in the wrong place, or you're in the wrong "Modules" section.)
7. Leave the checkbox alone.
8. Press "OK."
9. Restart the Website/Application, if necessary.

Potential issues
------------------------------

*This module is likely far from complete and may not cover all methods of retrieving a visitor's IP using ServerVariables

Feedback
------------------------------

Feedback encouraged, preferably via [CloudFlare Support](http://support.cloudflare.com).
